"Download":https://github.com/gocom/rah_swap/releases | "Packagist":https://packagist.org/packages/rah/rah_swap | "Issues":https://github.com/gocom/rah_swap/issues

Swap connected "Textpattern CMS":https://textpattern.com MySQL database link on the fly using a template tag. The plugin has the potential to allow pulling templates, articles and other content from different databases.

h2. Install

Using "Composer":https://getcomposer.org:

bc. $ composer require rah/rah_swap

Or "download":https://github.com/gocom/rah_swap/releases an installer package.

h2. Basics

bc. <rah::swap db="myNewDatabase">
    ...contained statement...
</rah::swap>

The plugin introduces a new tag, @<rah::swap/>@. The tag can be used both as a container and as a single, self-closing tag. When used as a container the database connection link is changed for just the wrapped code. The original link is restored on the closing tag pair.

h2. Attributes

*db*
Database's name. If @db@ is the only attribute set, currently connected database is changed using current connection's credentials (user, password, host). A new link isn't created, but merely the database is swapped reusing the old connection.
Example: @db="myDatabase"@ Default: _undefined_

*user*
Username used to connect to the database.
Example: @user="username"@ Default: _undefined_

*pass*
User's password. Can be left empty if the user doesn't have a password.
Example: @pass="password"@ Default: _undefined_

*host*
The database server. The @host@ can contain a hostname, a port number or a path to a local socket. Defaults to @localhost@.
Example: @host="hostname.tld:3306"@ Default: _undefined_

*dbcharset*
Database's character set. Usually this attribute should *not* be used, but should be left as it is. Textpattern uses UTF-8, and using non-unicode character set can cause unexpected results.
Example: @dbcharset="latin1"@ Default: _undefined_

*client_flags*
Extra flags passed to the database client. Normally you shouldn't worry about this attribute. Usually the attribute should *not* be used.
Example: @client_flags=""@ Default: _undefined_

*reset*
A boolean attribute that when set, resets the database connection back to its original state. If the tag is used as a container, resetting is done automatically on the closing tag pair without the need of the @reset@ attribute. When rah_swap's tags are used as self-closing single tags, use @reset@ when you want to resume to Textpattern's original database connection.
Example: @reset@ Default: _undefined_

*link*
Name of predefined database credentials config item. If the @link@ attribute is defined, the used credentials are pulled from a pre-defined config array variable, @$rah_swap@, stored in Textpattern's configuration file, @config.php@.
Example: @link="template_db"@ Default: _undefined_

h2. Configuration

With the help of the tag's @link@ attribute, database connection credentials can be saved to Textpattern's configuration file (i.e. @/textpattern/config.php@) instead of them being specified with the tag attributes.

Defining the database's connection credentials is done basically in the same way as Textpattern's core database details are defined. Rah_swap expects a global variable named as @$rah_swap@, containing a multi-dimensional array, allowing multiple links to be configured. Example config would look similar to following:

bc.. $rah_swap['link1'] = [
    'db' => 'MyDatabase1',
    'user' => 'MyUsername1',
    'pass' => 'MyPassword1',
    'host' => 'localhost',
];

$rah_swap['link2'] = [
    'db' => 'MyDatabase2',
    'user' => 'MyUsername2',
    'pass' => 'MyPassword2',
    'host' => 'localhost',
];

p. Where @link1@ and @link2@ would be the name of the link configurations and would be used as a @rah_swap@ tag's @link@ attribute's value.

bc. <rah::swap link="link1" />
<rah::swap link="link2" />

h2. Examples

h3. Simple usage example

The contents wrapped in the @<rah::swap>@ tags will be pulled from database named as **promotional_content_db**.

bc. <rah::swap db="promotional_content_db">
    <txp:article_custom category="promo_2011_06">
        <txp:body/>
    </txp:article_custom>
</rah::swap>

In the example @promotional_content_db@ would be a database used by second Textpattern installation. The installation would be used to host promotional content and campaigns redistributed to multiple sites.

h3. Showing downloads from a second installation

bc. <rah::swap db="downloads">
    <txp:file_download>
        <txp:file_download_link>
            <txp:file_download_name/>
        </txp:file_download_link>
    </txp:file_download>
</rah::swap>

Above serves file downloads from **downloads** database using Textpattern's "file tags":https://docs.textpattern.com/tags/file-tags.

h3. As a self-closing tag

Templates are going to be fetched from **templates** database.

bc. <rah::swap link="templates"/>
<txp:output_form form="header"/>
<txp:output_form form="cdn_template_banner_256x145"/>
<txp:output_form form="cdn_template_banner_256x145"/>
<rah::swap reset/>

The connection is reset back to normal using the @reset@ attribute.
